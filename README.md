# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis

### Overview

Our first module in DSI covers:
- Basic statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, descriptive statistics)
- Many Python programming concepts
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Visualizations
- EDA
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

You might wonder if you're ready to start doing data science. While you still have **tons** to learn, there are many aspects of the data science process that you're ready to tackle. Project 1 aims to allow you to practice and demonstrate these skills.

For our first project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates in the United States. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to address our problem statement.

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)
* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry.

### Problem Statement

My project is going to analyze the impact of educational spending on college entrance exam testing outcomes on a per state basis.
This aims to help educators, lobbyists, and state budget planners make more informed decisions when asking whether increased state investment is helpful or necessary.
I hypothesize that increased educational spending on a per student basis will have a strong positive relationship with testing outcomes.

### Datasets

#### Provided Data

There are 10 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. You are required to pick **at least two** of these to complete your analysis. Feel free to use more than two if you would like, or add other relevant datasets you find online.


* [`act_2018.csv`](./data/act_2018.csv): 2018 ACT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows))
* [`act_2019.csv`](./data/act_2019.csv): 2019 ACT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows))
* [`sat_2018.csv`](./data/sat_2018.csv): 2018 SAT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/))
* [`sat_2019.csv`](./data/sat_2019.csv): 2019 SAT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent))
**Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data
* [`expenditure.csv`](./data/expenditure.csv): 2018 per student budget spending state ([source] handcrafted from (https://www.governing.com/finance/Education-Spending-Per-Student-By-State.html)

### Deliverables


### Technical Report Starter Code

Future projects will require you to decide on the entire structure of your technical report. Here, we provide you with [starter code](./code/starter-code.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook that will help to guide your data exploration and analysis. **If you choose to edit the core structure of this notebook, make sure you don't exclude any of the requested operations**.

### Style Guide and Suggested Resources

[Tim Dwyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtimdwyer/) (former DSI student and TA) put together [this style guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-R-Metropolis/style-guide). Some recommendations are geared toward future projects (which will include modeling and span multiple notebooks), but generally these are great recommendations.

Here's a link on [how to give a good lightning talk](https://www.semrush.com/blog/16-ways-to-prepare-for-a-lightning-talk/), which provides some good recommendations for short presentations.

[Here's a great summary](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-with-data-a-data-visualization-guide-for-business-professionals-97d50512b407) of the main points of the book _Storytelling with Data_, which I can't recommend enough. [Here's a blog post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/8/9/my-guiding-principles) by the author about his guiding principles for visualizations.

### Submission

**Materials must be submitted on January 4th.**

Your technical report will be hosted on Github Enterprise. Make sure it includes:

- A README.md (that isn't this file)
- Jupyter notebook(s) with your analysis (renamed to describe your project)
- Data files
- Presentation slides
- Any other necessary files (images, etc.)

**Projects are to be submitted via Google Classroom.**

---

### Presentation Structure

- **Must be within time limit established by local instructor.**
- Use Google Slides or some other visual aid (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to a non-technical audience (executives with the College Board, school administrators, admissions counselors, State officials, etc.).
- Start with the **data science problem**.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, **CODE IS ALWAYS INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NON-TECHNICAL AUDIENCE**).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

### Rubric
Your local instructor will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.

**Scores will be out of 21 points based on the 7 items in the rubric.** <br>

In order to pass the project, students must earn a minimum score of 1 for each category.
- Earning below a 1 in one or more of the above categories would result in a failing project.
- While a minimum of 1 in each category is the required threshold for graduation, students should aim to earn at least an average of 1.5 across each category. An average score below 1.5, while it may be passing, means students may want to solicit specific feedback in order to significantly improve the project before showcasing it as part of a portfolio or the job search.

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they don't work out as well as you planned! While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll be prepared to succeed in the workforce**.
